# Mini-Twitter-Project
This Python program is a simple text-based social media simulator. Users can create accounts with a bio, make posts, view a feed of all posts, like posts, and edit their bios. Each post tracks the number of likes, and all user and post information is stored in dictionaries and lists. The program uses a menu system to interactively guide the user through these actions.
